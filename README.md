> JavaScript 3D game.

## HOWTO: Build ##

Repository does not include game textures and libraries. Before running this project, you should build it first. Follow these steps:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * Make sure you installed the Node Package Manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.org/));

2. Run `npm install`
  * This task will download required dependencies, including [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/);
  * Also, as post install task, `bower install` will be executed to download project libraries;
  * You will have `node_modules/` and `bower_components/` directories after this step;
  * See [package file](package.json) and  [bower file](bower.json) for the additional information;

3. Run `grunt build`
  * This task will create/update the game libraries under the `lib/` folder, build the game files and compile the styles.
  * See [Grunt file](Gruntfile.js) and [default.js](grunt/default.js) for the additional information about the tasks.

4. Download and unpack textures.
  * Textures is a binary data, so they are not included into the repository and you must download them manually. Get this [base archive](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40688668/base.zip) with data, unpack and place it under your game root folder.
  * Note, that this step will be incorporated into the previous actions in future.


## HOWTO: Run ##

Basically, this web application should run on a server. Game won't work properly due to cross-origin requests restrictions in browser's security policy. You must run game on the server (best practice), or make changes to the browser security settings. You can either follow step A or step B.

##### Option A: Node.js server #####
Run `node server.js` under the repository root.

##### Option B: Other solutions #####
See the following [article](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally).

## Dev information ##

#### Base content ####
* `loader.js` - resource load and game initialization.
* `Utils.js` - additions to the standard math library.
* `Settings.js` - changeable game settings: window size, fov, mouse sensitivity.
* `Caches.js` - cached (regular and preloaded) objects.
* `Objects.js` - simple world objects.
* `Quest.js` - quest parser and objects.
* `Player.js` - camera and user controls.
* `UI.js` - user interface.
* `World.js` - scene and complex game objects.
* `Engine.js` - renderer and rendering methods.
* `Game.js` - initialization, bindings and main game cycle.

#### Code ####
* Section, that matches `@#.*#@` regex serves as an example and will be removed in future.
* Event for the `h` (code: 72) keydown was removed from the dat.gui.js. It should be also removed for all future updates of this library.
