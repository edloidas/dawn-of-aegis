Dawn of Aegis
=============
JavaScript 3D game. Uses WebGL.

## HOWTO: Run ##

Basically, this web application should run on a server. Game won't work properly due to cross-origin requests restrictions in browser's security policy.

#### Step 1 : Game ####
Clone this repository or just download the [master archive](https://github.com/edloidas/dawn-of-aegis/archive/master.zip) and unpack it in the desired folder.

#### Step 2 : Textures ####
Textures is a binary data, so they are not included into the repository and you must download them manually. Get this [base archive](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40688668/base.zip) with data, unpack and place it under your game root folder.

#### Step 3 : Server ####
As been said, you must run game on the server (best practice), or make changes to the browser security settings.

##### Step 3 A: Node.js server #####
1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
2. Install [Connect](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect): `npm install connect`
3. Run `server.js` from the repository root.

##### Step 3 B: Other solutions #####
See the following [article](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally).
