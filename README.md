> JavaScript 3D game.

## Build ##

Repository does not include game textures, libraries and assembled sources. Before running this project, you should build it first. Follow these steps:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
	* It's always better to choose the latest stable version available: we are trying to keep everything up to date;
	* Make sure you installed the Node Package Manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.org/));
	* You can use [io.js](https://iojs.org/) instead of Node.js.

2. Run `npm install`
	* This task will download required dependencies, including [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/);
	* As post install task, `bower install` will be executed to download project libraries;
	* See [package file](package.json) and  [bower file](bower.json) for the additional information.

3. Run `gulp build`
	* This task will create/update the game libraries under the `lib/` folder, build the game files and compile the styles.
	* See [Gulp file](gulpfile.js) for the additional information about the tasks.

4. * Run `gulp data`
	* Textures is a binary data, so they are not included into the repository;
	* Alternatively, you can do it yourself: download the [base archive](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40688668/base.zip) with data, unpack and place it under your game root folder.


## Run ##

Basically, this web application should run on a server. Game won't work properly due to cross-origin requests restrictions in browser's security policy. You must run game on the server (best practice), or make changes to the browser security settings. You can either follow step A or step B.

##### Option A: Node.js/io.js server #####
Run `node server.js` (or `iojs server.js`) under the repository root.

##### Option B: Other solutions #####
See the following [article](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally).
